 ABOUT THIS MOD:
=====================================================================================

 This mod causes significantly expands on how Blight diseases work, changing how
 Redoran settlements near Red Mountain deal with the Blight and how the Player must
 deal with them.

 Features:
 - Blight diseases now have a visible effect on the infected entity. The Player, NPCs,
 and flora will now have a special blight effect dynamically applied and removed
 as they become infected and are cured. For humanoids, the effect is only applied to
 their skin.

 - Flora can contract and harbor blight diseases.

 - Active Transmission of Blight diseases between the Player, NPCs, and flora. No longer
 can you haphazardly talk to people or scavenge for ingrediants outside of Ald-Ruhn.
 Talking to people and gathering herbs have a chance of transmitting Blight diseases
 between both parties. You can transmit to NPCs and flora, and they can transmit to
 you. Watch out for those infectious trama roots...

 - Passive Tranmission of Blight diseases amongst NPCs, creatures and flora. The closer
 to Red Mountain that the transmission occurs, the higher chance of contracting a
 Blight disease. These diseases are automatically cured and removed over a random
 interval, preventing them from stacking too high and representing those NPCs
 and flora being cured.

 - Disease progression now causes Blight diseases to grow more infectious if left
 unchecked. Whenever you contract a Blight disease, you can between 2-3 days to cure
 it. If you do not, it will progress and you will become more sick. This will continue
 forever, so make sure to carry some cure blight disease potions! Additionally, this
 works across multiple diseases at once. Don't think that just because once disease
 progressed, another cannot.

- 3 new mouth covering scarves, created by Greatness7!

 - Face coverage is taken into account when transmitting the Blight. Actors with
 face shielding will have a lower chance of contracting a Blight disease than those
 without. Weak your mask! The more coverage, the better protected you will be.

 - NPCs will now have and wear the new face protection during Ash and Blight storms to
 protect themselves. To get face protection, the NPC must be within the infection
 range of Red Mountain. Wealthier NPCs have a higher chance of getting face protection.
 NPCs will equip their face protection during storms and remove them afterwards.

 - Blight storms can transmit the Blight to the Player.

 - Services are now restricted during Blight storms. Why would someone take you on a
 Silt Strider journey during a horrid Blight storm?

 - Support for all vanilla and mod added Blight diseases.
